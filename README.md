# Asteroids in Python
This is my second [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project. It covers some advanced features in Python and uses OOP to encapsulate data and functions.
# How to play
1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (package manager)
2. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Rangek78/pygame-asteroids
cd pygame-asteroids
```
3. Play:
```
uv run -m main
```
Move with W, A, S, D. Shoot with the Spacebar.
